This file contains a description of what each function does
The first function _putchar was a tough one to crack


0-putchar.c - uses the putchar function to print the word _putchar on the screen followed by a new line
1-alphabet.c - The main function calls print_alphabets which is linked to _putchar in a different function to print alphabets in lowercase
void print_alphabet_x10(void) - nested loop for inside while to print the alphabet in lowercase 10 times followed by a newline each time
3-islower.c uses a function int _islower(int c); to check if a character is lowercase and returns 1 if its true else it returns 0
4-isalpha.c - checks whether a character is uppercase or lowercase using isalpha()
